# OpenWeather Java App

This is a simple Java console program that shows the current weather for one or more cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.

It was built to practice working with APIs and JSON data in Java.

## Features
* Fetches real-time weather details (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition)
* Handles multiple city inputs
* Uses `HttpURLConnection` and the `org.json` library

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bhuvan2005-k/Open_Weather_API.git
   cd Open_Weather_API

2. Download the org.json library from [mvnrepository.com]
   Create a folder named lib in the project and put the downloaded .jar file inside it.

3. Add your API key in WeatherApp.java:
   String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

4. Compile and run the program:
 * Windows
      javac -cp .;lib/json.jar demo/WeatherApp.java
      java -cp .;lib/json.jar demo.WeatherApp
